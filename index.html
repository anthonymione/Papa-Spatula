		<h3 class="name">Zach Wooding</h3>
		<p class="bio-body">My name is Zach Wooding and I am a student at Boise State University studying Gaming, Interactive Media and Mobile Technology (GIMM). I have recently changed my major from Computer Science and expect to graduate before 2019. I grew up in Sumner, Washington. At the age of ten I began commercial fishing for Sockeye Salmon with my father in Alaska. After ten years of working as a crewman on my father's boat, Sports Fan, I took over running my own boat called the Legacy. I would eventually like to create mobile applications for businesses as well as continue my career as a fisherman. I have faced an extreme amount of adversity during my career as a captain, including a beached boat and a blown engine. I intended to use that adversity as a catalyst to push me to finish my degree and enter my career. I usually spend my time studying for school, playing video games, coding programs, and experimenting with hardware. I have had an significant amount of experience coding and working with micro-controllers; such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Pine 64, as well as programming languages like C#, and Actionscript.
